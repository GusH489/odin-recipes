HTML Project for the Odin Project Course.
This project has taught me about hmtl elements such as paragraph elements <p>, header elements <h1> <h2>, and text styling elements such as <strong> that make text bold, and <em> that emphazises text with an italic font. In addition to the list element which allows you to implement organized and unorganized lists. The Most useful parts of this html courses have to do with anchor elements and its attributes. The target attribute decided wether to open the link in a new tab or in the current tab. The rel attribute decided wether the the new opened website can interact and learn from the current website.
